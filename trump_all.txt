"I have great judgment. I have good judgment. I know what's going on." - About trusting his instincts. Through countless deals and negotiations, he always relied on his gut feeling. CNN criticized his judgment, but who became president in the end? Having the eye to see through the world is a powerful weapon.

"I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much… So I don't know if you would call that a weakness." - About relationships and trust.

He later explained that during his relationship with Marla, everything was stormy and confusing, but he eventually gained control and learned that even messy periods in life can be reorganized and mastered.
"I wish I'd had a great marriage." - Reflecting on his relationship with Melania during interviews. He acknowledged that marriage wasn't easy, having tried three times with mixed results. Some were failures, some were learning experiences, but he approached relationships with genuine effort and eventually found mutual respect.
"Find your limits and smash through everything." - Career advice given during a graduation speech. He shared how initially his father helped him start in real estate, but building his name in the center of New York was entirely his own battle. The media called him crazy, banks didn't trust him, but he pushed without limits and eventually built Trump Tower.
"As long as you are going to be thinking anyway, think big." - His success philosophy. He explained that when people say "start small to become big," he started big from the beginning. Casinos, airlines, real estate - everyone said it was reckless but he trusted his instincts. Why think small when you're going to spend time thinking anyway?
"What separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate." - About handling crises. He recalled being heavily attacked during presidential debates by media, competitors, and even his own party members. In those moments, he remained calm, reacted strategically, and pushed forward. The result? He became president.
"Sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war." - About learning from setbacks. He once suffered major losses in casino business when everyone said "Trump is finished." But that experience led him to pivot to branding business, which brought even greater success.
"Sometimes your best investments are the ones you don't make." - His business philosophy. He once had an opportunity for a massive casino deal that looked profitable, but something felt wrong. He walked away, and that deal eventually failed. Sometimes "NO" is the best decision.
"Success comes from failure, not from memorizing the right answers." - About learning through experience. When he started business after college, he learned more on the streets than from textbooks. Once he struggled with construction permits, and that experience made him master law and contracts.
"I do play with the bankruptcy laws – they're very good for me... It's not personal. It's just business." - About his strategic use of bankruptcy laws. When he experienced bankruptcy in casino business, many criticized him, but he moved with strategy instead of emotion, used legal restructuring, and eventually returned with greater assets.
"Show me someone without an ego, and I'll show you a loser." - About confidence and self-esteem. He explained that when you enter a room, you can tell who the leader is - confidence speaks for itself. He always considered himself number one from early on, and that's where everything started.
"I have great judgment. I have good judgment. I know what's going on." - About trusting his instincts. Through countless deals and negotiations, he always relied on his gut feeling. CNN criticized his judgment, but who became president in the end? Having the eye to see through the world is a powerful weapon.
"I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much… So I don't know if you would call that a weakness." - About relationships and trust. In business, he was betrayed many times, especially by people who were initially friends. But he never stopped trusting people because while some disappoint, others provide opportunities.
"I've had bad luck with all my wives. The first one left me and the second one didn't. The third gave me more children!" - Humorous take on his three marriages. He explained that love is similar to business - contracts, expectations, and strategy. He did his best with each wife, but sometimes compatibility just isn't there. Despite the humor, there was real pain, but ultimately his children made his life richer.
"Between men and women there is no friendship possible. There is passion, enmity, worship, love…" - His philosophy on male-female relationships. For him, women were never just friends - emotions always followed. Even with Melania, they started as friends but eventually became genuine love.
